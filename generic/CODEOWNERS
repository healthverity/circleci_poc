# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# The team maintaining and developing this repo will be the
# global owner. Whenever a pull request is opened, the team
# will be automatically requested to review a pull request.
# Replace <team> with the name of your GitHub team.
*       @<team>

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence.

# In this example, @doctocat owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
# /build/logs/ @doctocat

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
# docs/*  docs@example.com

# In this example, @octocat owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
# apps/ @octocat

# In this example, @doctocat owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository.
# /docs/ @doctocat
